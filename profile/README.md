## What is This?
This is a silly project I decided to work on after watch the League of Legends Worlds Championship. It includes a data pipeline to train a simple predictive model for a numbers-heavy game, apply explainability methods to get insights, and finally build a web app for easy consultation of the trained model. Despite being specific to the game League of Legends (LoL), I believe this is a good example of a simple, but realistic use-case for predictive machine learning, that can also work for a variety of applications, such as other games and sports. The core tech used for this project includes Python (NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, SHAP and Flask), JavaScript (React) and Docker.

## Repositories
- [DataCollection](https://github.com/Intigram/DataCollection): every script that was used in the process of collecting and preparing the data.
- [WinModel](https://github.com/Intigram/WinModel): the python code used to train, test and analyse the model for win prediction.
- [FrontWebInterface](https://github.com/Intigram/FrontWebInterface): the front-end React app for using the model to predict given a player.
- [BackWebInterface](https://github.com/Intigram/BackWebInterface): the back-end Flask API for using the model.
